## Files & Resources
- You might've read the READ.ME already, but if you haven't, here's some more C&G context!
- Figma / Clean & Green Philly Figma - https://www.figma.com/login?is_not_gen_0=true&resource_type=team
- Clean & Green Drive / UX Research Folder - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Hq4punNTuoeun-7SrZSyySVg365csmlp

## Skills You Can Contribute
- Figma (we use any design tool!)
- User research: conducting interviews, analyzing data, creating surveys

## Volunteer Flow
- Be ready to ask your questions to the Slack channel (link)!
- Current and most pertinent issues can be found on Issues (link) on Github --> Search through to find UX specific tasks
- **Not all tickets have been refined.** For tickets that need more context, Slack the clean-and-green-philly-ux channel and look through previous messages for fuller context.
- Use the weekly meetings (Tuesdays 7:30EST) for demo and refining work as well as the clean-and-green-philly-ux channel for iterations.
- Find a Acceptance Criteria (this is our definition of done) for each item alotted in each issue.
- Each Issue can only be considered complete once it has been signed off from a C&G Philly co-lead and UX co-lead.
- Items that have been worked on with others in other departments should be mentioned in the general C&G Slack channel for awareness.

## Notes
- If you have picked up an issue (thanks and yay!) but haven't been able to respond to the Clean & Green Philly slack in 2(+) weeks, your issue might get picked up by someone else. We will try to let you own a piece of work as much as possible, but if the task is non-urgent, the 2 week rule will stand.
- Items high in urgency will need to be accomplished faster, but will still be available for volunteers to pick up. If you have been able to pick up one of these items (thanks and yay!) but haven't been able to respond to the Clean & Green Philly slack 1-3 days, someone else will pick up your work to ensure it gets completed.
